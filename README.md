Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data

Objective:
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

Project Workflow:

Data Collection: Gather data from social media platforms using APIs or web scraping. Focus on collecting relevant fields such as post content, timestamps, and user metadata.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data by removing irrelevant content, normalizing text, and tokenizing. Apply lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their base forms.

Sentiment Analysis: Classify sentiments using pre-trained models like VADER or TextBlob, and assign polarity scores (positive, negative, neutral) to each post. Optionally, detect specific emotions.

Data Aggregation: Group sentiment scores by time intervals or topics to analyze trends over time.

Data Visualization:

Create time-series plots to show sentiment changes over time.
Generate word clouds to visualize frequently mentioned words.
Use bar charts to display sentiment distribution.
Optionally, map sentiment geographically.
Insight Generation: Identify trends, correlate sentiment with events, segment the audience, and compare sentiment patterns across competitors.

Reporting: Build interactive dashboards or summary reports to present key findings and actionable insights.

Tools and Technologies:

Python (NLTK, Spacy, VADER, TextBlob, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Social Media APIs (Twitter, Facebook Graph)
Dashboard Tools (Tableau, Power BI, Dash, Streamlit)
